//! Jcode applets: declarative, sandboxed custom UI hosted by Jcode Desktop.
//!
//! An applet is a provider (the agent, a local process, an MCP server, or
//! native Desktop code) that describes UI as a [`View`] tree of a closed set of
//! native components. The host renders it, owns layout, theme and input, and
//! sends user intents back as [`HostMessage::Action`]. No provider code runs in
//! the host process.
//!
//! Applets are independent of tool calls. Each mounted [`Instance`] declares a
//! [`Placement`]: a standalone panel, a sidebar section, an overlay, a strip
//! above the composer, or inline in a transcript anchored to a tool call, a
//! message, or simply the end of the conversation.
//!
//! Everything a host receives must pass [`validate::validate_document`] before
//! rendering. Unknown future node types deserialize to [`NodeKind::Unknown`]
//! and render their fallback text, so older hosts degrade gracefully.
